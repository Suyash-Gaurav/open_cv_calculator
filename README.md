# Open_CV_Calculator
This is my another project on computer vision. I've used python cv2 and from cvzone.HandTrackingModule I've used HandDetector to detect the Hands.
If someone is trying to start object oriented programming this will be best for them. If you have any question regarding this project feel freee to contact me
